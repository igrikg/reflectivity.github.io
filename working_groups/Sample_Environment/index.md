The full scope of the working group is:

Information gathering: The SE working group should identify current issues with sample environment and report news to the community on suppliers, sample environment developments and any studies on comparison of sample environments. 

Writing Educational Material: The group will edit website pages demonstrating common sample environments with photos, diagrams and basic sample preparation descriptions, with links to information on sample environments available at different facilities. 

Creation and deployment of surveys: The SE working group will deploy surveys to the neutron reflectometry community and other researchers investigating interfaces to identify gaps in capability in SE.
