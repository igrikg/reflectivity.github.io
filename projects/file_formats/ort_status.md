This list may not be exhaustive or up-to-date. Please contact us with your beamline details or, alternatively, you can edit the list directly by becoming a member of the GitHub group that administers this webpage: contact [Andrew](mailto:andrew.mccluskey@bristol.ac.uk).

The tables have a colour coded indicator of the status of implementation
* Implemented: All beamline routinely output in the ORSO format
* Partially Implemented: At least 1 beamline routinely outputs in the ORSO format
* Working Towards: The facility is working on implementation
