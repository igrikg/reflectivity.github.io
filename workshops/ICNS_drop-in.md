# **ORSO at ICNS 2025**

The Open Reflectometry Standards Organisation (ORSO) aims to help standardise the field of reflectivity, and push towards FAIR data and reproducible workflows. 

Many of the members of ORSO are reflectivity experts; this event will be a drop-in session where we aim to provide 1-to-1 help for others within the reflectivity world:

Are you a PhD student looking for learning resources? 

Are you a postdoc wanting to create complex fitting models?

Or even are you an instrument scientist interested in implementing the ORSO file writer on their beamline?

Come by, say hi, and see if we can help
