##ORSO@ICNS 2025

The Open Reflectometry Standards Organisation (ORSO) aims to help the field of reflectivity standardise, and push towards FAIR data and reproducible workflows. 

Many of the members of ORSO are reflectivity experts; this event will be a drop-in session and aims to provide 1-to-1 help advice with anything we can advise on, from PhD students looking for learning resources, to postdocs wanting to create complex fitting models, to instrument scientists interested in implementing the ORSO file writer on their beamline.
