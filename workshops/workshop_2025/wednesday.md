## Reproducibility Working Group
10:00-12:00 (UK), 11:00-13:00 (Europe), 05:00-07:00 (US East coast), 19:00-21:00 (Australia East coast): 
12:00-14:30 (UK), 13:00-15:30 (Europe), 07:00-09:30 (US East coast), 21:00-23:30 (Australia East coast):

This session will split into two parts:
- Following the successful sessions in pervious meetings on generating advice on defining some best practice for reporting results and inputs to Bayesian analysis, we would like to begin a new initiative on publishing a checklist for reproducible publishing in reflectometry. This session will begin with a discussion on how useful and general this would be, and try to define what we think "best paractice" actually is.
- For neutron reflectometry we have, for quite some time, been trying to collect data on a "round-robin" sample to compare neutron instruments. This session will look at the results from this study and recruit volunteers to actually write the paper. We would also like to consider what we would need to make a similar study for Synchrotron beamlines.


## Orsopy and a standard model language 
20:00-22:00 (UK), 21:00-23:00 (Europe), 15:00-17:00 (US East coast), 05:00-07:00 (Australia East coast): 

This session will start a discussion around the model language. The session will aim to understand what is missing from the current definition of the the language, for example, can it be adapted to improve representaion of models for biological systems.

What can be done to improve uptake?
- How do we ensure all facilities give users data in .ort format.
- What is the added value to users for using this format (The ORSO text format is now reasonably well defined and the orsopy tool is available, but can the decumention be improved).
 
Finally is there some merit in defining a standard format (or formats) for fit results. There is often a bottleneck after running analysis to get the fit, the SLD profile(s) and the confidence intervals etc out of the analysis software into an appropriate format for publication. The vision here is to add some kind of export funcionality into the analysis software to export those things in formats suitable for common plotting software (Origin, Sigmaplot, Python (Plotly, Matplotlib etc), Matlab etc). This would be similar to the various image formats - not a single format, but a small collections of standard formats.
