As a new working group of ORSO, the sample environment (S.E.) working group are working on how to improve sample environment for reflectometry but also to increase information sharing on available and developing sample environments. In this session:
- We will have a general discussion session on sample environment identifying the user community needs and discussing the response of the [ORSO questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=HDZmP36oWEGPYZnoLbPKyGNjGj0JBmlFoh6F5vEqATRUNUlaNjU1Mk9CUEFBMElSMVBVMVkyNFFVUC4u&route=shorturl) (30 minutes),
- We will then have more focused mini sessions on solid-liquid flow cells and on troughs, giving the opportunity for groups/facilities that require support to ask questions and find support from partner facilities. (30 minutes)
- Finally will focus on population of the Sample Environment ORSO webpages. We wish to build a comprehensive list of environments available at different facilities, and we hope that you will take this time with us to contribute information on available environments at facilities but also novel sample environments by research groups. We would also in general like to build educational pages on sample environment use. Please attend the session if you are interested in contributing and helping to build what would be a valuable resource for the community. (1 hour)
