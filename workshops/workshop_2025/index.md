# the 7th Open Reflectometry Standards Organisation ORSO annual meeting

The Annual General Meeting of ORSO will take place online over the **23th-27th June 2025**. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss topics of interest to the ORSO community.
The program will consist of scientific and technical talks together with discussion forums for each of the working groups

**In advance of the meeting please complete the [ORSO Survey](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=HDZmP36oWEGPYZnoLbPKyGNjGj0JBmlFoh6F5vEqATRUNUlaNjU1Mk9CUEFBMElSMVBVMVkyNFFVUC4u&route=shorturl)**

## [Registration is now open](https://indico.ess.eu/event/3810/)

# Agenda:

## Tuesday 17th June: Satelite session organised by the "Liquid surface scattering working group"
**15:00-117:00 (UK), 16:00-18:00 (Europe), 10:00-12:00 (US East coast), 00:00-02:00 (18th June, Australia East coast):**

- Scientific talk: **Chen Shen, 'Liquid surface scattering at Petra III'**

**Abstract:** Chen will present the beamline P08 of PETRA III. The beamline has three main setups: a six circle diffractometer, the Langmuir trough GID setup, and the Uni-Kiel owned LISA liquid surface diffractometer. He will also talk in details the recent news from our Langmuir trough GID setup and GIXOS - pseudo reflectivity method.
- Discussion on matters relating to X-ray Scattering from liquid interfaces

## Monday 23rd June: Plenary Sessions

The plenary sessions will introduce ORSO and summarise our activities since the [last meeting](https://www.reflectometry.org/workshops/workshop_2024/). 
There will also be some scientific talks on subjects of interest to the ORSO community (speakers to be confirmed).
Since the agenda is scheduled to try to cover all time zones, we acknowledge that it may be difficult to attend all these sessions. We will therefore record the plenary sessions and post the videos here after the meeting.
Where feasible we will repeat the breakout discussion sessions in different time zones or attempt to schedule at a time accessible to all. Please bear with us for unsociable meeting times!


### Plenary Session 1
**08:00-10:30 (UK), 09:00-11:30 (Europe), 04:00-06:30 (US East coast), 17:00-19:30 (Australia East coast):**

**Recordings of all talks will be uploaded to the orso youtube channel.**

#### Session Schedule
- **Tom Arnold** Introduction and discussion on how to better promote/publicise ORSO
- Scientific talk: **Anton Le Brun, 'Recent Advances in Sample Environments for Neutron Reflectometry'**
- Scientific talk:  **Michael Haberl, 'Photon-Limited X-Ray Reflectometry: Improved Fitting via the Anscombe Transform'**
- Scientific talk:  (to be confirmed)

  - Data Analysis Working group

### Plenary Session 2
**18:00-20:00 (UK), 19:00-21:00 (Europe), 13:00-15:00 (US East coast), 03:00-05:00 (Australia East coast):**

#### Session Schedule

  - Education and Outreach Working group
  - Reproducibility Working group
  - Data Formats Working group  

## Tuesday to Thursday: Breakout discussion sessions

For the discussion sessions we would like to ask one of the attendees to act as a scribe to keep some notes on the discussion. This person should be able to attend the final plenary session on Friday and give a report about what happened in the discussion. For further details on the breakout sessions, please see the separate pages for each day:

### [Tuesday 24th June](/workshops/workshop_2025/tuesday.md)

### [Wednesday 25th June](/workshops/workshop_2025/wednesday.md/)

### [Thursday 26th June](/workshops/workshop_2025/thursday.md)

## Friday 27th June: Concluding Plenary Session

In the final session of the workshop we will summarise the working group discussions and look to the future with some further science talks

**12:00-14:30 (UK), 13:00-15:30 (Europe), 07:00-09:30 (US East coast), 21:00-23:30 (Australia East coast):**

#### Session Schedule
- Annual General Meeting.
  - Recruitment of a temporary stand-in chair for the Reproducibility working group (to replace Andrew McCluskey)
- Summary of the working group sessions.
- Scientific talk: **David P. Hoogerheide, 'The CANDOR polychromatic reflectometer'**

**Abstract** The CANDOR reflectometer at the NIST Center for Neutron Research marries the advantages of time-of-flight polychromatic reflectometers, such as those commonly employed at pulsed neutron sources, to the high time-averaged flux of a reactor neutron source. CANDOR’s unique energy dispersive detector, currently comprising 108 individual wavelength-sensitive neutron detectors operating at over 90% efficiency, allows simultaneous detection of cold neutrons in the 4 Å to 6 Å wavelength range. In this talk, I will describe instrument design, detector operation and performance, and data reduction considerations. Reflectivity curves measured by CANDOR using polychromatic detection will be compared to standard curves measured at NIST’s monochromatic reflectometers, and the performance of CANDOR’s polarization capabilities will be discussed. For measurements of materials at solid/liquid interfaces, I will show that CANDOR’s high flux and intrinsic background rejection enables measurement to about twice the scattering vector, and hence resolution, of conventional measurements.
