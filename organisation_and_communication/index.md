ORSO is an open group of reflectometry scientists from across the globe that are interested in improving our field through collaboration.
Our focus is on [neutron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_reflectometry) and [X-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_reflectivity) reflectometry, and it should be noted that the term [reflectometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectometry) is also used for a number of techniques that are not covered by this organisation.

ORSO is managed by a group of elected [working group chairs](https://www.reflectometry.org/organisation_and_communication/contacts). The chairs meet regularly and the minutes of their meetings are available [here](https://hackmd.io/team/ORSO-meetings?nav=overview) 

The rules by which ORSO is governed and a code of conduct is available [here](./orso_governing_principles.md/).

On this webpage, we host information about reflectometry that we have generated to inform others and detail projects that are being developed within our working groups.
The organisation hosts annual [workshops](../workshops/) that are either in person or virtual meetings where we discuss topics of interest to the community.

If you would like to get involved, find out how to participate [here](./how_to_participate.md).
